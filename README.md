# :rocket: terraform-localstack
This repository contains an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project designed using Terraform, LocalStack, Ansible, and GitHub Actions. It includes a FinOps workflow powered by Infracost, as well as security and compliance checks using TFSec and Checkov.

## üß∞Tech Stack
- Terraform ‚Äì Provision cloud infrastructure as code.
- LocalStack ‚Äì Run a fully functional local AWS cloud stack for testing and development.
- Ansible ‚Äì Automate configuration and software deployment.
- GitHub Actions ‚Äì Automate workflows for CI/CD, security checks, and FinOps.
- Infracost ‚Äì Estimate cloud costs in pull requests (FinOps).
- TFSec ‚Äì Static analysis for Terraform templates.
- Checkov ‚Äì Infrastructure security and compliance scanner.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: CI/CD with GitHub Actions
The repository uses GitHub Actions to automate:

```terraform.yml``` ‚Äì Validates Terraform, runs plan, apply (optional).

```finops-infracost.yml``` ‚Äì Adds cost estimates in PRs.

```security-checks.yml``` ‚Äì Runs TFSec and Checkov for code security.

## üí∞FinOps with Infracost
This project integrates Infracost to show cloud cost changes in pull requests. This helps drive financial accountability and decision-making.

**Example PF Comment:**
```
Monthly cost estimate for this change: +$25.00  
Previous cost: $75.00  
New cost: $100.00
```
## üîê Security & Compliance
TFSec and Checkov automatically scan the Terraform templates to ensure compliance with security best practices.
